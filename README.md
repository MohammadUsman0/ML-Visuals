# ML-Visuals
ML Visuals is an effort to help the machine learning community in improving science communication by providing free visuals and figures. You are free to use the visuals in your machine learning presentations or blog posts. You donâ€™t need to ask permission to use any of the visuals but it will be nice if you can provide credit.Currently, I have created few figures. I will continue to add more common figures and basic elements in upcoming versions. Think of this as free and open artifacts and templates which you can freely and easily download, copy, distribute, reuse and customize to your own needs. My all figures are in .vsdx format which can be edit in [Microsoft Visio]() or we can use online tools like 
- [Aspose](https://products.aspose.app/diagram/editor/vsdx)
- [Visual Paradigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/)
- [draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/)
